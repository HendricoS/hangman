# Hangman Game

# Rules of the Game

Hangman is a word-guessing game where you try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. The game provides feedback on your progress, and you have limited chances to guess the word correctly.

# How to Play

1. When you start the game, a random word will be selected for you to guess.

2. You will see underscores representing each letter in the word. Your goal is to guess the word one letter at a time.

3. Click on the alphabet buttons to guess a letter. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, you'll receive a strike.

4. You have a maximum of 7 incorrect guesses before you lose the game.

5. You can use the "Hint" button to receive a hint (a random letter from the word) up to 2 times during the game.

6. If you correctly guess all the letters in the word before running out of guesses, you win!

7. If you reach 7 incorrect guesses, you lose.

# Dictionary

round. Click on the link at the bottom of the page where it says Dictionary to go to TheFreeDictionary.com website.
